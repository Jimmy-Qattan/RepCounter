# HERE IS HOW TO CONNECT ALL THE WIRES AND COMPONENTS!

1. Have an Arduino.
2. Get your breadboard.
3. Plug LCD Display to breadboard. DO NOT PLUG INTO GROUND, NOR VOLTAGE CLIPS!

4. The next section of steps refers to steps for the LCD Display.
5. First of all, connect the Ground Component of the Arduino to the Negative clip bar on the Breadboard, and connect the 5V Component on the Arduino to the Positive clip bar on the Breadboard.
6. Connect the K on the LCD Display to the Ground component of the Breadboard, or the Negative side of the Breadboard.
7. Connect the A on the LCD Display to the 5V component of the Breadboard, or the Positive side of the Breadboard.
8. Connect the D7 on the LCD Display to the digital PIN 12 of the Arduino component.
9. Connect the D6 on the LCD Display to the digital PIN 11 of the Arduino component.
10. Connect the D5 on the LCD Display to the digital PIN 10 of the Arduino component.
11. Connect the D4 on the LCD Display to the digital PIN 9 of the Arduino component.
12. Connect the E on the LCD Display to the digital PIN 8 of the Arduino component.
13. Connect the RW on the LCD Display to the Ground component of the breadboard, or the negative side of the breadboard.
14. Connect the RS on the LCD Display to the digital PIN 7 of the Arduino component.
15. Connect the V0 on the LCD Display to a 10K Resister on the breadboard, then connect each side of the Resister to the Ground and 5V components, or the Positive and Negative sides of the breadboard.
16. Connect the VDD on the LCD Display to Positive side of the battery part of the breadboard, or the 5V part of the breadboard.
17. Connect the VSS on the LCD Display to the Negative side of the battery part of the breadboard, or the Ground part of the breadboard.

18. The Next few steps refer to the Ultrasonic Sensor module of the project.
19. Connect the VCC pin the of the Ultrasonic Sensor to the Positive side of the breadboard, or known as the 5V part of the breadboard.
20. Connect the GND pin of the Ultrasonic Sensor to the Negative side of the breadboard, or known as the Ground part of the breadboard.
21. Connect the Trig pin of the Ultrasonic Sensor to the Digital PIN 4 of the Arduino Component.
22. Connect the Echo pin of the Ultrasonic Sensor to the Digital PIN 3 of the Arduino Component.

23. The next 2 steps refer to the Active Buzzer moldule of the project.
24. Connect one pin of the Buzzer to the Positive side of the breadboard, also known as the 5V station of the breadboard.
25. Connect the other pin of the Buzzer to the Digital PIN 5.
26. If this combination does not work, then try switching the wires connected to the Active Buzzer since there are no labels smh.

27. The Last 3 steps refer to the Infered Reciever module of the project.
28. Connect the Y component of the IRrecv moldule to the Digital PIN 6 on the Arduino component.
29. Connect the R component of the IRrecv module to the Positive side of the breadboard, also known as the 5V station of the breadboard.
30. Connect the G component of the IRrecv module to the Negative side of the breadboard, also known as the Ground station of the breadboard.
